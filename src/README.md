# PAIN WAVE

A wave of **PAIN**. This game was made in a 48 hour time span for the [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/).

This game has only been tested on Mac OS X 10.13.3. It requires gamepads and was built with XBox 360 controllers in mind.

All other configurations are untested. If you want to submit changes to enable compatiblity for other platforms, they are welcome.

Requires:

1. Python 3.6
2. Pygame (Installed either at the system level or [following the instructions for creating a virtualenv here](https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/issues/203/window-does-not-get-focus-on-os-x-with#comment-32656825), due to limitations on OS X)
3. XBox 360/One controllers and the [associated Mac OS X drivers](https://www.jacobtomlinson.co.uk/gaming/2016/02/24/use-xbox-360-pad-with-el-capitan/).
